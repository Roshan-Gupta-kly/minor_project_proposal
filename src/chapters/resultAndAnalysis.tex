\chapter{EXPECTED OUTCOMES}

\section{Accident Prediction and Crash Detection}
The system is expected to analyze multisensory fused data including \gls{acc}, \gls{gy}, heading direction, fire detection (\gls{fs}), and crash impact signals (\gls{cs}) to compute a real-time accident risk score. Based on this risk score, the system will predict potential accident scenarios and detect crash occurrences under impact conditions using \gls{ml}-based inference.

\section{Event Data Recorder (EDR)}
The \gls{edr} module is expected to continuously record and store structured sensor and event data in real time. When an accident occurs, the \gls{edr} preserves critical event information, including sensor readings and system decisions. This recorded data provides reliable evidence for post-accident analysis and investigation.

\section{Alert and SOS Signaling Mechanism}
The system is expected to trigger real-time alerts or warning signals, such as buzzer activation, to notify the driver upon detecting high accident risk scenarios. In the event of a confirmed accident, the system generates \gls{sos} signals and transmits them to nearby emergency helplines through the \gls{gsm} module.
