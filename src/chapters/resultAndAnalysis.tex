\chapter{EXPECTED OUTCOMES}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Accident Prediction \& Crash Detection} \\
    The system is expected to analyze multisensory fused data including \gls{acc}, \gls{gy}, heading direction, fire detection (\gls{fs}), and crash impact signals (\gls{cs}) to compute a real-time accident risk-score. Based on this risk score, the system will predict the potential accident scenarios and detect crash occurrences under impact conditions using \gls{ml}-based inference.

    \item \textbf{EDR - Event Data Recorder} \\
    The \gls{edr} module is expected to continuously record and store structured sensor and event data in real time. When an accident occurs, the \gls{edr} preserves critical event information including sensor readings and system decisions. The purpose of this module is to provide reliable event data for post-accident analysis and investigation.

    \item \textbf{Alert and SOS Signals} \\
    The system is expected to trigger real-time alerts or warning signals such as buzzer activation to notify the driver upon detecting high risk-score scenarios for accidents. In the event of a confirmed accident, the system generates \gls{sos} signals and transmits them to nearby helplines via the \gls{gsm} module.
