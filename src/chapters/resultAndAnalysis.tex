\chapter{RESULTS AND ANALYSIS}

%  WRITING GUIDELINES FOR RESULTS AND ANALYSIS CHAPTER
%  ====================================================
The Results and Analysis chapter presents the outcomes of your project and critically analyzes
them. This chapter demonstrates whether your system meets requirements, compares performance
against objectives and baselines, and interprets findings. Results should be presented objectively
with appropriate visualizations, while analysis provides context and explanation. This chapter should be full of charts, tables, and figures illustrating your system's performance and behaviour.


%  LaTeX quick refs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Always reference figures and tables in the text before they appear.
    \item Use the cleveref package; write \verb|\cref{fig:label}| or \verb|\Cref{tab:label}| for automatic formatting (add \verb|\usepackage{cleveref}| to the preamble).
    \item Keep captions descriptive and use unique labels per chapter (e.g., \texttt{fig:my-figure}, \texttt{tab:results}).
\end{itemize}
