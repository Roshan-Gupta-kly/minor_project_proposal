\textbf{“EDR (Event Data Recorder) Based Intelligent Vehicle Accident Prediction with Multisensor Fusion and Edge Summarization”} highlights the prevention mechanism and alert mechanism in the case of an accident. According to WHO “Approximately 1.19 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes.” The casualties on the road are often misunderstood and blamed on drivers but the causes are often different. The real cause is never known. The miscommunication and misinformation of vehicle status, in pre-event and post-event of accident often lead into bad accident prevention. 
This project focuses primarily on prevention and post-event accident event data recorder and alerting via SOS in case of an accident. Multiple sensors like Flame Sensor, Gyroscope, GPS, Crash sensors are connected and embedded with a MultiSensor Fusion algorithm which gives accurate and comprehensive inferences than using some individual sensors with complex algorithms. In a microcontroller, by using the Multifusion algorithm, we integrate a waterfall model for the analytical viewpoint of accident. We use real time data. The real time data is event summarized for multiple instances and is fed into the classifier (Random Forest) for either alerting in case of accident or warning in case of accident prevention. This project aims at solving the manual driven vehicle problem to alert the driver and also aims on being expandable for self-driven cars because accidents can happen to anyone,anything or anyway.
