% \section{Proof of Theorem 2:} Convergence of Gradient Descent Method for Convex Functions.
% \section{Gaussian Distribution} 
% The Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution, is a continuous probability distribution characterized by its bell-shaped curve. It is defined by its mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$). The probability density function (PDF) of a Gaussian distribution is given by:
% \[
% f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\!\left(-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right).

\chapter{FEASIBILITY}

        \section{Technical Feasibility} 
        The proposed system is implemented using the \gls{esp32s3} microcontroller integrated with multiple sensors, including \gls{acc}, \gls{gy}, \gls{ms}, \gls{fs}, \gls{cs}, an ultrasonic sensor, along with \gls{gps} and \gls{gsm} modules. The software development is carried out using open-source platforms such as the Arduino \gls{ide} and \gls{espidf}, while Python-based libraries including NumPy and Pandas are used for sensor data analysis and \gls{ml} model development. Training and validation datasets are obtained from open-source repositories such as Kaggle and supplemented with real-time sensor data, ensuring reliable model performance and real-world applicability.

        \section{Economic Feasibility} 
        All hardware components used in the project are readily available and cost-effective, making the overall system economically viable for large-scale deployment. The use of free and open-source software tools eliminates licensing costs, further reducing the total project expenditure. This cost-efficient design supports practical implementation in real-world vehicle safety applications.

        \section{Operational Feasibility} 
        The system operates using a \gls{sim} card and a \gls{gsm}-enabled mobile network, allowing reliable communication without internet dependency. The \gls{gsm} module enables the \gls{esp32s3} to transmit alerts, \gls{sos} messages, and GPS-based location information to predefined contacts or emergency services during accident or fire detection events. This ensures continuous and effective system operation in both urban and remote environments.
